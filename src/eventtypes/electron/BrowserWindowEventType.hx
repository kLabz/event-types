		closed, which will also be called when the window is reloaded. In
		Electron, returning any value other than undefined would cancel the
		close. For example: Note: There is a subtle difference between the
		behaviors of window.onbeforeunload = handler and
		window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handler). It is recommended to
		always set the event.returnValue explicitly, instead of just returning
		a value, as the former works more consistently within Electron.
