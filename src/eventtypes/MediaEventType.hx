		The ended event is fired when playback or streaming has stopped because

		This event occurs in three related but unique contexts:

		* Elements based upon HTMLMediaElement (<audio> and <video>) fire ended
		  when playback of the media reaches the end of the media.

		* Media streams' tracks, which are based on the MediaStreamTrack
		  interface, fire ended when the track's source permanently stops
		  sending data on the stream.
		  There are various ways this can happen, including:
			* There is no more data left to send.
			* The user revoked the permissions needed for the data to be sent.
			* The hardware generating the source data has been removed or
			  ejected.
			* A remote peer has permanently stopped sending data; pausing media
			  does not generate an ended event.

		* A Web Audio API node has stopped playing, either because it's reached
		  a predetermined stop time, the full duration of the audio has been
		  performed, or because the entire buffer has been played. See
		  AudioScheduledSourceNode.

	/**
		The pause event is sent when a request to pause an activity is handled
		and the activity has entered its paused state. This is most commonly
		sent to media elements after their media has been paused through a call
		to the element's pause() method.

		The contexts in which the pause event occurs:

		* Any element based on HTMLMediaElement (generally <audio> or <video>)
		  may receive this event after its media has been paused by calling the
		  element's pause() method.
			* The event is sent once the pause() method returns and after the
			  media element's paused property has been changed to true.
			* A common use case is detecting when a pause has occurred in order
			  to update the user interface, such as by switching the image
			  displayed on a play/pause button.

		* When using the Web Speech API, a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object
		  representing a speakable phrase receives a pause event when the
		  controlling speech synthesis object is paused by calling
		  SpeechSynthesis.pause().

		between about 4Hz and 66Hz (assuming the event handlers don't take
		longer than 250ms to run). User agents are encouraged to vary the
		frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of
		processing the event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more
		frequent than the user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the
		video.
